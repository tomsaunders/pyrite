## Pickled Yoda Reads \*.TIE files

- The TIE Mission format is now relatively well understood and parsed out.
- The weakest areas are the briefing and waypoints - hardly checked as part of the existing high score stuff / basic reader
- Existing editors focus on flight groups. What else could be done?
- A flow that matches the player experience - briefing, questions, mission, debrief?
